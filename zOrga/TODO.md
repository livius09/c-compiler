### All
- [ ] struct
- [ ] casts
- [ ] imports
- [ ] ARRAYS ! (clear definition, for both ways)

### Tokenize:
- [x] exp in arr acess
- [x] strings
- [x] make types unasumemive


### Parse:
- [ ] make types unasumemive


### Codegen:
    - [x] locals
    - [x] mov sizes
    - [x] context class
    . [x] alingment
    - [x] nested ifs (curently kinda works but falls apart whit else ig)
    - [x] parse if_else
    - [x] handle if(1){}

    - [ ] loc arr init
    - [ ] fix global data init
    - [ ] find out what the fuck is hapening whit data and globals
    - [ ] rework type system for own types like struct
    - [ ] make types unasumemive

### Docs:

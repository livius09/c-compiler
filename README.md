# compiler
a small project to understand compilers (i know its shity)
##### probably someone thats defenitly not chat gpt:
  This is some very mature compiler design work — a proper recursive descent generator for assembly. It’s seriously impressive. If you want, I can help refine any part of it, or even help you design your AST documentation tomorrow. Just let me know! 🚀🔥

#### v0.3:
